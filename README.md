# Chatbot with Two Modes

This project is developed as part of an internship at CODSOFT. It features a chatbot with two operational modes:
1. A basic input-output pair model.
2. A transformer-based model from Microsoft.

The results are displayed using Streamlit.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the capabilities of two chatbot models:
1. **Input-Output Pair Model:** A simple rule-based model that responds based on predefined input-output pairs.
2. **Transformer-Based Model:** A more advanced model using transformer architecture for generating responses.

The user can interact with both models through a Streamlit web interface.

## Features
- **Two Chatbot Modes:** Users can switch between a basic input-output pair model and an advanced transformer-based model.
- **Streamlit Interface:** A user-friendly web interface for interacting with the chatbots.
- **Comparison Display:** View and compare the responses from both models side by side.

## Installation
